# Design of an Open Source, Low Cost, DIY Cycle Kit
This project was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of an open source, low cost, DIY cycle kit. I have succeeded in developing a design for a bicycle frame constructed from handrail clamps, and documented the design so that anyone can continue the work or build a prototype. The design can be customised by the user, and sample geometries were included in the assembly drawings. FEA was used to analyse the design, and the bicycle frame was optimised in response to the results. The final design weighs approximately 8.4kg and costs approximately £276 for the frame alone. Further work could include building and testing prototypes, further FEA analysis, espescially focusing on the bottom bracket clamp in dynamic loads, and designing other geometries using the same components such as a cargo bike or recumbent tricycle.

You are free to copy, distribute, and make changes to these designs. If you use these designs for your own project, please give credit to Hannah Rosen, link back here, and publish any new documentation in line with [Open Source Hardware principles](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/). Please also consider sending me pictures and telling me how you got on! You can contact me at diycycle57@gmail.com, or open an issue in this repository. Thanks.

Notes 22/05/2020:
1. If the reader wishes to build a prototype, and "cheap" is higher up on their list of priorities than "lightweight," some or all of the aluminium clamps could be replaced with cast iron clamps.
    1. The cast iron Kee Klamps use the same part number as the equivalent aluminium Kee Lite clamps, without the "L" prefix. For example, 10-6 is equivalent to L10-6.
    1. Other, cheaper, brands are available, but care should be taken to ensure they are rated to the same loading conditions. A brand comparison and part number conversion table can be found in the report (linked above).
1. Note that a commuter bike geometry is shown as a starting point, but the reader is encouraged to adapt the design to suit their requirements, such as designing a tandem or quad-cycle. Sample geometries for different sizes of the commuter bike geometry (with tube lengths) are shown on the Rev 2 assembly drawing.
    1. An idea for further work is to write a piece of code which would allow users to customise geometry and see a diagram and automatically generated tube lengths without the use of Inventor or any other complex, expensive CAD software - similar to [this webapp](https://www.bikegeocalc.com/) by Anders Torger.
1. Note that this is ready for anyone to take these designs and build a prototype, but more testing needs to be done before it can be certified 100% bombproof. Proceed with caution.
     1. In particular, attention should be paid to the behaviour of the bottom bracket clamp under dynamic loads, and after many load          cycles (including bending moments about all three axes of rotation). Of particular concern is whether the grub screw will loosen over time (it is advised to use a thread locker and check periodically with a torque wrench) and whether the tubes will become damaged over time where the grub screws bite into them. The best way to test this might be to build a bike and ride it around for a while.
     1. If after further testing it is found that the bottom bracket clamp cannot withsand the cyclic loads, Rose+Krieger clamp *Block Form WR 42* (code no: 214200030266) could be used instead of the single socket tee (kee 10-67). This is more suited to dynamic loads, but would add weight and cost.
     1. Alternatively, the geometry could be redesigned so that the down tube is also supporting the bottom bracket,
        1. This could be done using a 90 degree side outlet tee (kee 21-7) and an elbow (such as kee 55), similar to the chainstays in the current design. 
        1. The variable side-outlet tee (kee 19) is another option which should be investigated, but note that the testing data for the aluminium Kee Lite clamps states that type L19 is "not suitable to absorb bending load, bending moments are not allowed". The cast iron Kee Klamp testing data however rates type 19 to 1.25kN of bending load resistance. 
        1. More information on bending moment resistance should be sought from Kee Systems if type L19 is used. Testing should also be done to determine whether the asymmetry and short gripping of types 19 and L19 would cause problems when supporting the diagonal loads on the bottom bracket.
        1. The downtube would then need to be connected to the head tube with either an angle tee (such as kee L29-7) or an elbow (such as kee 55) and a single socket tee (such as kee L10-7).
    1. Both of these options would mean that the seat tube needs to be the same size as the bottom bracket. Unless a bottom bracket shell can be found or made (simple enough if one has access to a lathe, or is willing to contract a third party to machine it for them) which fits a Size 6 Kee Klamp (possibly with the use of a shim), this would mean that size 7 tubing would need to be used for most of the frame, as in Revision 1 of the current design (assembly drawing and BOM linked above). This would add cost and weight, but is still feasible.
1. The only custom part (apart from cutting tubes to length) is the seat post link. It can be made easily from flat bar with just a hacksaw, a drill, and a file. The part drawing is linked above and should be easy to understand even for people with no engineering knowledge. 
    1. The clamps are all standard; simplified CAD models were created from the dimensions given by the manufacturer in order to model the assembly. Part numbers and vendor links are given in the bills of materials. The catalogues are linked above.
1. If the prototype is built and there is a problem with rattling, simple rubber washers/gaskets should be used in the swivel sockets. 
    1. This could also help if the surface of the swivel sockets used as "drop outs" (technically, frame ends) does not have a good enough surface finish. Just pop a rubber washer between the frame end and the axle nut.
    1. The number of washers used as spacers depends on the thickness of the washers, especially in the seat post clamp/seatstay assembly. Adjust as appropriate.
1. If there is a problem with the seat post rattling, use a spacer to fill the gap between the seat post and the seat tube. Pvc pipe, shim stock, or folded aluminium foil could be used. To stop it from slipping down the seat tube, drill a horizontal hole through the bottom of the seatpost below the spacer (through both sides of the tube), and insert a length of threaded bar. Secure it in place with two nuts on the threaded bar inside the seat post, tightened to brace outwards against the ID of the seatpost. Make sure it protrudes far enough to hold the spacer in place, but not far enough to scratch against the ID of the seat tube.
1. A placeholder for the drivetrain was not modelled, because the user can choose to use any number of options - fixed gear, hub gears, cassette gears, or even a belt drive. In the case of fixed gears, chain tensioning would be facilitated by adjusting the sliding clamps. However, regardless of one's preferred drivetrain, it would be advisable to model a simple placeholder and check there is enough clearance, making small adjustments to tube lengths if necessary, before ordering parts.
