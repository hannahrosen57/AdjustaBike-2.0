# AdjustaBike-2.0
This project is building on the Adjustabike, which was an adjustable DIY bicycle kit concept developed by a previous Final Year student, Jamie. The aim is to accomplish the same goal, but to ensure the kit is as accessible to the lay person as possible by using mostly off-the-shelf parts and simple manufacturing methods, and to ensure that the kit is truly open-source by documenting it thoroughly.
