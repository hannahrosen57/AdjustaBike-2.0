# Design of an Open Source, Low Cost, DIY Cycle Kit
This project was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of an open source, low cost, DIY cycle kit. I have succeeded in developing a design for a bicycle frame constructed from handrail clamps, and documented the design so that anyone can continue the work or build a prototype. The design can be customised by the user, and sample geometries were included in the assembly drawings. FEA was used to analyse the design, and the bicycle frame was optimised in response to the results. The final design weighs approximately 8.4kg and costs approximately £276 for the frame alone. Further work could include building and testing prototypes, further FEA analysis, espescially focusing on the bottom bracket clamp in dynamic loads, and designing other geometries using the same components such as a cargo bike or recumbent tricycle.

Everything you need to get started should be in the "_START_HERE" folder.
