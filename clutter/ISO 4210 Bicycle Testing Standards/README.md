The standards are as follows:

code              | title
------------------|---------------------
ISO 4210          | Cycles — Safety requirements for bicycles
BS EN 14764       | City and trekking bicycles — Safety requirements and test methods *(note: this is outdated and was replaced by ISO 4210, but still helpful)*
ISO 8098          | Cycles — Safety requirements for bicycles for young children

The former is the most relevant. I couldn't find the requirements for some of the tests, so I went looking and found the numbers I wanted in the second and third standard, but then realised they were hiding (in plain sight) in part 2 of ISO 4210 all along. I'll leave them here anyway since I already went and found them.

For reference, these are the parts of ISO 4210:

- Part 1: Terms and definitions
- Part 2: Requirements for city and trekking, young adult, mountain and racing bicycles
- Part 3: Common test methods
- Part 4: Braking test methods
- Part 5: Steering test methods
- Part 6: Frame and fork test methods
- Part 7: Wheels and rim test methods
- Part 8: Pedals and drive system test methods
- Part 9: Saddles and seat-post test methods
