The standards are as follows:

code              | title
------------------|---------------------
ISO 4210          | Cycles — Safety requirements for bicycles
BS EN 14764       | City and trekking bicycles — Safety requirements and test methods *(note: this is outdated and was replaced by ISO 4210, but still helpful)*
ISO 8098          | Cycles — Safety requirements for bicycles for young children

The former is the most relevant. I couldn't find the requirements for some of the tests, so I went looking and found the numbers I wanted in the second and third standard, but then realised they were hiding in part 2 of ISO 4210 all along. I'll leave them here anyway since I already went and found them.
