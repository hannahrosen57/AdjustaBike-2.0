# Project Log

This document is intended to be an ongoing record of the progress of the AdjustaBike 2.0 project.

## Monday 3rd February
### Julian House Bike Workshop
Julian House Bike Workshop is a charitable enterprise in Bath which accepts donated bikes, fixes them up, and sells them, using the profits to help the homeless community. They also provide training and employment for homeless people, and run workshops where members of the public can learn how to maintain their own bikes.

Before I start building a wacky DIY bike, I'll need to know where I'm starting from. I will also need a good understanding of the various ways in which the other components attach to and interface with the frame, so that I can design the frame accordingly. To these ends, I paid them a visit. The gentleman working there was very helpful and told me to pop back anytime. Here is a rough summary of what I found out:

* To maybe visit/contact:
  * There is a DIY bike show called [Bespoked](http://www.bespoked.cc/) which is awesome and would be worth a visit, even though it's in May. It's also in Bristol though, which is good, because it could have been anywhere in Europe.
  * The Bicycle Academy in Frome has various courses to teach people how to build a bike frame from scratch (by welding). They can be a bit expensive, though. They also make and sell their own jigs, which are often cheaper than alternatives.
  * Julian House has truckloads of scrap bikes that I could have for free and take apart, cut up, or canabalise for parts. They're also always happy to answer questions about bike contruction and maintenance.
* To look into:
  * Bike fitting jigs are contraptions designed to have a totally adjustable geometry (wheelbase, rake, etc.) to allow riders to find a geometry suitable for them.
  * Folding bikes such as the [Fubifixie](https://fubifixie.com/) and [split frame](https://splitbikes.com/products/split-frame-kit) [bikes](https://splitbikes.com/products/split-frame-kit), which have a threaded tube joining the two halves of the top tube together
  * DIY fork or outsource fork?
* To know:
  * The head tube and bottom bracket are usually mass produced and bought in
  * The seatpost comes in lots of different sizes to fit the seat tube. Tolerances are important
  * Dropouts are usually made to order as they are so specific and tightly toleranced
  * Chain line/alignment should be considered
  * Distance between dropouts is important. Needs to fit gears (if applicable) and wheel
  * For fixies, the chain tension needs to be set correctly. The back wheel is on sliders and can be clamped in place with a threaded nut. Freewheel mechanism?
  * Every bike has a geometry sheet with key distances and angles
